              I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
              current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel

              been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who
              had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
              course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter.
              The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
              life. Since completing the course, I've successfully switched
              careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. Lorem
